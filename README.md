# Cybertest-Pytest-Runner
GUI for using pytest with a 90's retro cyberpunk feel.

Cybertest Pytest Runner — a Windows-ready testing utility with a fully custom neon cyberpunk GUI. It runs tests using python -m pytest, allowing execution even outside a virtual environment.

The interface includes selectable flags (-vv, -q, -x, or none), and you can switch flags and re-run tests instantly to compare results. You can test all files in a folder or select individual .py files.

Results can be exported as TXT or HTML, and a Test Summary panel shows pass/skip/fail counts parsed directly from the pytest output. A Last 5 Runs history sits in the lower-right sidebar—click any entry to instantly reload its full terminal output.

The design features a glowing neon cyberpunk theme with a retro-90s terminal vibe, complete with a blinking cursor animation and a fake CPU/RAM HUD for style.

Source .py code attached. Coded with Python version 3.10.11 Enjoy!
